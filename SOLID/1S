Single Responsibility Principle
- each class should have only one reason to change (to change by only one object)
- ex:

class Invoice {
    void calculateTotal() {
        // logic to calculate total
    }

    void saveToDatabase() {
        // logic to save invoice to DB
    }

    void printInvoice() {
        // logic to print the invoice
    }
}

- this class has three responsibility

class Invoice {
    void calculateTotal() {
        // logic to calculate total
    }
}

class InvoiceRepository {
    void saveToDatabase(Invoice invoice) {
        // logic to save invoice
    }
}

class InvoicePrinter {
    void printInvoice(Invoice invoice) {
        // logic to print invoice
    }
}
