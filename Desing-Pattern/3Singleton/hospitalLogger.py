# Whenever a class is instantiated, two methods are called:

# __new__ : Responsible for creating a new instance of the class.
# __init__ : Initializes the instance.

# âœ… What is __new__?
# __new__ is a special method in Python responsible for creating a new instance of a class.
# It is called before __init__, and it actually returns the instance.
# It's used in Singleton patterns to control object creation.
